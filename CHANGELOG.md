## [Unreleased]


## [12.0.0] - 2025-04-22

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Require `webonyx/graphql-php:^15.0`. This is a breaking change if you use `include_debug_message` or `include_trace`. The fields `debugMessage` and `trace` will no longer be present in the root payload of the errors, but instead under the `extensions: { ... }` object.


## [11.0.1] - 2025-04-22

### Fixed
- Update data loader behaviour for integer ID-based "associative" keys [#96](https://github.com/glesys/butler-graphql/pull/96)


## [11.0.0] - 2024-05-28

### Added
- Laravel pint.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Require Laravel 11 and PHP 8.2.

## [5.1.0] - 2021-03-29

### Added
- The new `beforeExecutionHook` hook lets your GraphQL controller (using the `HandlesGraphqlRequests` trait) inspect the schema and query before entering the execution phase.

### Fixed
- Upgrade graham-campbell/testbench@^5.6 because of breaking change in `GrahamCampbell\TestBench\AbstractPackageTestCase`.


## [5.0.0] - 2021-03-11

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Strict check for expected value in `assertPromiseFulfills`.
- **BREAKING**: Improved performance when using data loaders with a tailored implementation based on `amphp/amp` instead of `leinonen/php-dataloader`. See [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md) for details on how to upgrade.


## [4.0.0] - 2020-12-10

### Added
- Support PHP 8
- In addition to `schemaPath()` it's now possible to override the `schema()` method. This can be useful if your GraphQL schema needs to be fetched from some other source than a file on disk. [#33](https://github.com/glesys/butler-graphql/pull/33)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Upgrade to webonyx/graphql-php@14.3.0. See https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/blob/v14.3.0/UPGRADE.md for breaking changes.


## [3.4.0] - 2020-10-06

### Changed

- Support Laravel 8.


## [3.3.0] - 2020-10-02

### Added
- `AssertsPromises` trait, useful for testing data loaders.

### Changed
- Custom implementation of `CacheMap` with improved keys to prevent excessive looping.


## [3.2.0] - 2020-08-03

### Added
- Union support ðŸŽ‰. Types are resolved using the same technique as for interfaces: `$source['__typename']`, `$source->__typename`, `Parent@resolveTypeForField()` (`Query@resolveType` for queries and mutations) or class base name.

### Fixed
- Don't recursively convert Collection to array in DataLoader.


## [3.1.0] - 2020-03-13

### Changed

- Require PHP 7.2.5.
- Support Laravel 7.


## [3.0.0] - 2020-01-30

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removes leading slashes in the default namespace configuration to better support dependency injection with the laravel container. [#24](https://github.com/glesys/butler-graphql/pull/24)


## [2.2.0] - 2019-09-12

### Added
- Support for shared data loaders when resolvers use the same underlying data.


## [2.1.0] - 2019-09-05

### Changed
- Support Laravel 6 ðŸŽ‰.


## [2.0.1] - 2019-06-20

### Fixed
- When resolving `Boolean` values from arrays or objects `false` was incorrectly filtered out, resulting in a `null` value instead.


## [2.0.0] - 2019-05-17

### Added
- Interface support ðŸŽ‰. Types are resolved using `$source['__typename']`, `$source->__typename`, `Parent@resolveTypeForField()` (`Query@resolveType` for queries and mutations) or class base name.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Upgrade to webonyx/graphql-php@0.13.4 for improved performance and specification compliance. The `category` and `validation` keys previously available next to `message` in errors has now been moved to the `extensions` part of errors as per the [June 2018 GraphQL specification](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Errors).
- **BREAKING**: Support for various casing from source data. Previously Butler GraphQL assumed `snake_case` for source data attributes when resolving fields (to mimic the Eloquent standard). This has now been extended to support `snake_case`, `camelCase` and `kebab-case` by default. To change this behaviour you can override the `propertyNames(ResolveInfo $info): array` method in your GraphQL controller. The old `propertyName(ResolveInfo $info): string` method has been removed.


## [1.2.1] - 2018-11-21

### Fixed
- Stop catching Exceptions in `HandlesGraphqlRequests->fieldFromResolver` to avoid intercepting Exceptions from the service container.
- Pass `operationName` from the request to `GraphQL::promiseToExecute`.


## [1.2.0] - 2018-09-14

### Added
- Decorate the response with debug information when using [barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar).

### Changed
- Upgrade webonyx/graphql-php@0.12.6 for improved schema language support.

### Fixed
- The code in `HandlesGraphqlRequests->errorFormatter()` always assumed `\Exception` from `\GraphQL\Error\Error->getPrevious()` when it fact it returns `\Throwable`. We now ensure that we always pass `\Exception` to `ExceptionHandler->report()`.


## [1.1.2] - 2018-09-07

### Fixed
- Use `base_path()` instead of `app_path()` to ensure the default config works in Lumen.


## [1.1.1] - 2018-09-07

### Fixed
- Handle reporting of GraphQL errors (invalid queries and schema validation errors).


## [1.1.0] - 2018-09-07

### Added
- Implement error reporting of exceptions during requests.


## [1.0.0] - 2018-09-06

### Added
- Simplified setup with auto-disovered service provider with easy-to-use conventions.
- Use a schema.graphql file to define your GraphQL API.
